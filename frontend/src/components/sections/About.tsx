        <p>I'm an all-around creative with over a years of experience working remotely.</p>
        <p>
          I started my career as a social media designer, where I learned the fundamentals of
          graphic design and visual storytelling. I then spent more time as a Product UI/UX
          Designer, which taught me how to lead a design team effectively, lead projects, work
          closely with CEOs and department heads, and manage both clients and timelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I work as a creative with versatile design expertise, usually with brand-focused
          projects for startups and small businesses across different industries. I combine design
          thinking with creativity to help brands communicate clearly and meaningfully through
          visuals that connect.
