        <p>
          I grew up talking to myself and myself almost fluently. Maybe that's why I never craved
          being heard. I often wonder if people have someone who truly listens to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          What people tell me, I listen. I remember. Over time, I noticed that when I look people in
          the eye, I start seeing their stories. Their scars, once hardened, still break. They find
          safe with me, and that feels like grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know I can't heal anyone, but I get to be there, learn from them, and somehow bring
          their story to life through design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early in my career, I worked with a client who was frustrated that his ideas meant nothing
          more than what was being built. I wasn't the lead designer, but I sat down with him and
          listened. I pretended myself as if I get what I wanted to save to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I got this chance, and I did. He was happy, I understand what he wanted and
          turned it into something real—a visual that worked for everyone in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've done the same for others since. A coffee who wanted a logo to honor her late dog, so
          I drew them together in a simple outline. She said she never thought she'd see them
          together again. The coffee didn't have a photo with her late, so I drew them together in a
          simple outline. She said she never thought she'd see them together again—but now she has
          one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Put the chaos away. I helped her see what a sound goes beyond code—a tattoo between and
          the warmest love. And what the message was, she told me, "I am seen."
        </p>
        <p className="text-cream">
          That's where I learn. This is what I love doing. I design to help people feel seen,
          understood, and proud of what they create.
